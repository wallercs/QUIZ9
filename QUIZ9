Explain in your own words when you would use an inner join and when you would use a left join. (What is the difference)

An inner join will exclude rows that  are null in either of the keys columns in the ON clause.
A left join will not exclude any rows even if the joining row is NULL in it's key column. I left the previous question's join statements in my solution to question 4 because they do not affect the result grid.
